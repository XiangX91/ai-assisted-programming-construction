# Tutorial 1: Uncovering Safety Hotspots with AI-Powered Data Storytelling
## Objective: 
This tutorial will walk you through the process of using an AI assistant to analyse a real-world construction safety dataset. You will learn how to move from raw data to a compelling, actionable narrative that can be presented to stakeholders.

## Tool Used: 
Any conversational AI assistant capable of data analysis (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Julius AI).

## Dataset: 
nyc_construction_incidents.csv (Available in the /data directory of this repository).

## Scenario and Context:
Imagine you are the Health and Safety Manager for a large construction firm with multiple high-rise projects across New York City. Leadership has noticed a recent uptick in safety incidents and has tasked you with preparing a report for the quarterly review.

Instead of presenting a dense spreadsheet, your goal is to create a compelling data story. This story should not only show what is happening but also reveal where the problems are concentrated and why they might be occurring, leading to a clear, data-driven recommendation for action.

We will use the "And, But, Therefore" narrative framework to structure our story.
